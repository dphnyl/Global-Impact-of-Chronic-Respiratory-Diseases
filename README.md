Evaluating the Global Impact of Chronic Respiratory Diseases A Comprehensive Analysis of Environmental Risk Factors

## Topic Description
Chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) have become a global concern, ranking as the third leading cause of global mortality (Emerson Augusto Baptista, Sudeshna Dey, and Soumya Pal 2021), with four million deaths in 2019 (GBD 2019 Chronic Respiratory Diseases Collaborators 2019). Approximately 7.4% of the world’s population (545 million people) grapple with CRD, significantly impacting their daily lives and life expectancy (GBD Chronic Respiratory Disease Collaborators 2020). It is imperative to understand the incidence, morbidity, and mortality patterns of CRD on both a global and regional scale. Despite its widespread impact, CRD has received **less public attention and research funding compared to other well-known diseases** (Wassim W Labaki and MeiLan K Han 2020). 

This study aims to **investigate environmental risk factors related to air pollution, which directly or indirectly trigger incurable CRD symptoms.** It will provide insights into the broader implications of CRD and will help guide preventive measures, screening, treatment, research activities, and enhance public awareness of the disease’s severity (Wassim W Labaki and MeiLan K Han 2020). This study’s focus is on **CRD as a whole**, rather than solely on one specific type of CRD.
